findent: Indents/beautifies/converts Fortran sources.
         Prints dependencies based on:
	  - definitions and uses of modules and submodules
	  - include, #include and ??include statements
	 Findent can emit a script that uses findent to
	 create a dependencies file for use in an Makefile.

 - findent supports Fortran-66 up to Fortran-2018
 - findent can convert from fixed form to free form and vice-versa
 - findent honours cpp and coco preprocess statements
 - findent is validated against all constructs in 
   'Modern Fortran explained, Incorporating Fortran 2018, Metcalf e.a.'
 - findent honours OpenMP conditionals
 - findent runs in Unix and Windows
 - high speed: 50K - 100K lines per second
 - wrapper for processing one or more files in one call available
      for Unix and Windows (wfindent and wfindent.bat respectively)
 - vim, gedit, emacs: findent optionally emits configuration files
   for these editors to use findent as a plugin.
 - gui frontent available in a separate package: jfindent

Unix-Linux users with a 'decent' shell and make: 
    prerequisites: gnumake, g++
    make findent and wfindent:    
               download findent-x.y.tgz
             $ tar xf findent-x.y.z.tgz
             $ cd findent-x.y
	     $ ./configure --prefix=<Your installation directory, default /usr/local>
	     $ make clean
             $ make
	       On systems with sudo (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, ...):
	     $ sudo make install
	       On systems without sudo (Redhat, Scientific Linux, ...):
	     $ su -c 'make install'
	       if bison or flex are found, they will
	       be used to regenerate the parser and lexer
	       sources. See ./configure --help

    You can create an Windows executable 
       (requires Ubuntu package g++-mingw-w64-i686):
	     $ ./configure --with-windows
             $ make clean
	     $ make

	If things are ok:
	   findent.exe will be available in src/
	   wfindent.bat is available in scripts/

Unix-Linux users for whom above recipe does not work:
    prerequisites: a Bourne shell (sh, bash), C++ compiler
    make findent:    
               download findent-x.y.tgz
             $ tar xf findent-x.y.z.tgz
             $ cd findent-x.y
	     edit simplemake.sh to fill in the correct values of
	        the name of the C++ compiler, default: g++
		the compile flags, default: -O2
		the name of the program to create, default: findent
	     $ sh simplemake.sh
	     copy the generated program to the desired location
	     ( e.g. $HOME/bin).
    make wfindent:
             in the directory 'scripts' you find a template
	     for wfindent: wfindent.tmpl
	     edit wfindent.tmpl: change 'findent-location' into
	     the path to findent e.g. /usr/local/bin/findent.
	     Copy wfindent.tmpl to the desired location, e.g.:
	     $ cp wfindent.tmpl $HOME/bin/wfindent

Windows users: download findent-x.y.zip
               $ unzip findent-x.y.zip
               $ copy findent.exe C:\WINDOWS
	       $ copy wfindent.bat C:\WINDOWS


All systems:

Usage:    $ findent -h
Examples: $ findent < in.f90 > out.f90
          $ findent -i4 -Rr < in.f > out.f90
          $ wfindent -i4 -Rr *.f

Usage with Make:

          $ findent --makefdeps > makefdeps
	  $ chmod +x makefdeps
	  use something like the following in your Makefile:
	    include deps
	    dep deps:
	    	   ./makefdeps *.f90 > deps
	   Of course, if makefdeps is not adequate for you, you 
	   can create your own script, possibly inspired by makefdeps.
