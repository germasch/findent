.SH NAME
wfindent \- Indents, converts and relabels Fortran program sources
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wfindent
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\-\fR] [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Wfindent is a wrapper for findent(1), calling findent for each of the 
files. The files are overwritten by the modified version. A sanity
check is made before overwriting an input file.
Files that are not regular and readable and writable are silently skipped.
.SH NOTE
The end of the options is reached when a flag containing a '.' 
(e.g. 'prog.f90') is found, or when the flag '-' is found. 
.PP
See 'man 1 findent' or 'findent -h' for the options. Only options that
create a (probably modified) version of the input are effective.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The environment variable FINDENT influences the working of wfindent.
If set, wfindent will use this as the location of findent.
